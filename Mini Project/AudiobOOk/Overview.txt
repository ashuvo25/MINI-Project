PDF to Audiobook Converter Documentation
Overview:
This project converts a PDF document into an audiobook.
It utilizes Python libraries to read the text from a PDF file and convert it to speech,
providing a simple user interface for file selection and playback control.

Libraries Used:
-- PyPDF2: Used to read the content of the PDF file.
-- pyttsx3: A text-to-speech conversion library in Python.
-- Tkinter: A standard GUI library in Python, used here for the file dialog to select the PDF file.
How It Works?
*PDF File Selection:
The program starts by opening a file dialog, 
allowing the user to select a PDF file from their system.

*Reading the PDF File:
Once the PDF is selected, the PyPDF2 library is used to read the contents of the file.
The number of pages in the PDF is determined and displayed.

*Text to Speech Conversion:
The pyttsx3 library initializes a text-to-speech engine.
The program loops through each page of the PDF, extracts the text,
and uses the text-to-speech engine to convert the text to speech.

*User Playback Control:
During playback, the user is given control to pause, resume, or quit the audiobook playback.
The user can pause the playback by pressing 'p', resume by pressing 'r', or 
quit the program by pressing 'q'.

*Overall View:
The PDF to Audiobook Converter is designed to be a straightforward tool
for converting text-based PDF documents into audio format. It provides an easy-to-use 
interface for selecting files and controlling playback, making it
accessible to users who want to listen to their documents rather than read them.
The combination of PyPDF2 and pyttsx3 ensures that text extraction and conversion 
are handled efficiently, while Tkinter provides a familiar and simple way to 
interact with the file system.
